# Languages.  

## Prolog
    Compiled prolog appears to be native only, but I think Ciao has a JVM module (use is likely to be complex).
## Clojure
    Clojure is based on the the JVM. As such, it compiles to fast code which is transportable to web and Android applications.
## Python
    Python is a well-developed language providing access to a vast library including games engine. It is, however, a scripting language.
