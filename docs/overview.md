# Overview of the adventure project.  

    
## Plan.  

    1. Development of a general adventure engine.
    2. Initially test with a haunted house adventure, modular
    3. Additional modules then to be added to expand to a game "Universe"
    4. Modules must link in naturally
    
## Ideas.  

    1. Adventure series based on Transcendental Investigations Agency.
    2. Modular - completion of each opens access to the next
    3. Non-local puzzle solutions (players have to search internet or use own knowledge)
    4. Non-local generally - anything is possible
    5. Potential inspiration:
       - Alice in Wonderland
       - Sherlock Holmes
       - 
    6. Players can solve problems by searching the internet
    7. Player can be the assistant of a slightly insane investigator or can play as the investigator
    
    
## Gameplay.  
    
    1. I'm hoping to develop a natural language interface.
    2. Each module to have "innate" problems and problems which will require research
    3. Research attracts more points
    4. Point linked to website league table with chat-room
    5. Subscription or one-off fee?
